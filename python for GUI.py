#you have to pack logic with toolkits in python ex:- Tkinter
#GUI basic:- windows,linux,IOS:-these are the set of API's from this we can call kerbal and allow it fopr formatoin of windows and other more funcctions
# windows call then desired operation done
# for small projects:-TK GUI toolkit, WX python(interface WX windows),J python(for java),pyQT
# these are the tools which call Kernal of OS and then perform the tasks
# html(basic) -> css(for design of htlm)-> javascript(client side logic)
#     gui (client side)->python->logic->design(python) os ki API's ko hi tkinter ke andt cll krte hai'
# there is gthe risk in the tkinter they can see the logic of our source code which we provided them as a GUI
# so we have to made a modular form from the APIs  njo ki tkinter application ko apke khudke serbver se connect kre or kon kon apke server ko connct kr rha hai  vo ap log access token ke mddt se record kr skte hai"
